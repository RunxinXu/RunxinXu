This is Runxin Xu [[google scholar]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dRp21l4AAAAJ&hl=en). 

Currently I am a third-year Master's student at Peking University under the supervision of Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://icl.pku.edu.cn/cy/cbb/index.htm) [[google scholar]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests mainly lie in natural language processing, especially 1) document-level and few-shot information extraction, and 2) effective and efficient pre-trained language model.
